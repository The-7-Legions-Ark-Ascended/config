Do not try to cluster warp with a Magic Dino either in inventory or uploaded. It will not work; the dino data is not present on other servers. We will fix this as soon as it is possible to do so.\n\n[2024-08-03 14:00 UTC] We're back, baby! Now featuring a cluster, Primal Chaos, and Ark Descended! Other changes abound!",

This section documents quirks that players have experienced that all players on our server should know about to reduce the odds of loss resulting from a misunderstanding of modded game mechanics. This is NOT an all-inclusive list of quirks; it's just ones that have impacted our players over time.\n\n- Modded dinos cannot be teleported into vanilla boss arenas by an obelisk. You CAN teleport modded dinos into a vanilla boss arena by feeding an Awesome Dino Tracker to the dino and then using the right click function of the Awesome Remove to summon that dino to you while you are inside the arena.",

Do not bring up controversial topics in global or public channels. Also, always ask if a controversial topic is ok before bringing it up even in private channels.\n\n2) No trolls allowed. No intentional trolling, feigning idiocy, shitposting, or blatant lying. We are a community of people with similar interests just here to have a good time. We do not condone abusive behavior. This is not the place for trying to get a rise out of others.\n\n3) Do not DM our team members. We have a support ticket system in place on our Discord server. Visit us there and submit a ticket to ask for help.\n\n4) No doxxing: We do not allow distribution of ANYONE's sensitive or personal information.\n\n5) Use appropriate survivor names. No blank names, no long names, no URL names, and no non-ASCII Unicode characters in names. Names that contain non-standard characters or emojis are subject to admin name change.\n\n6) No advertising. No referral links. No buying/selling/trading anything for real life goods or money.\n\n7) We do not allow players to use our platform to send others invitations to other Discord servers, game communities, or game servers.\n\n8) Use common sense. If you're doing something you think is wrong, it probably is and will probably get you some attention from the admins.\n\n9) Use English in global chat. If you need to speak another language, use whisper, tribe, or alliance chat.",
          "text2": "1) VIP players receive thank you gifts from our team after donating. These thank you gifts are meant to be just that: a way of saying thank you to the player who made the donation. However, Ark has several game features which enable VIP donators to utilize some of thank you gifts to potentially produce dinos or resources for other players at no cost to the VIP player. Please understand that this is not allowed. Therefore the following rules apply to VIP-related items and dinos unless otherwise noted:\n\n| - VIP players are allowed to breed VIP Exclusive dinos when the chance to do so comes around, but the offspring of a VIP Exclusive dino is also considered VIP Exclusive and MAY NOT be shared with other players\n| - VIP players MAY share any base furnishings they may have received as a thank you gift with tribe mates only\n| - All other VIP items or VIP Exclusive items may ONLY be used by the VIP player who originally received them.",
          "text3": "1) Each tribe is limited to one main base up to 50x50 and one water breeding platform up to 20x20.\n\n2) No pillaring or foundation spamming.\n\n3) No building or deploying sleeping bags in artifact caves or blocking artifact cave entrances with your base. This includes placing teleports--no teleports allowed in artifact caves or cave entrances.\n\n4) Your base should be at least 250m apart from each other. You can use map markers to measure distance by placing a map marker at your desired base location, activating it by clicking it on the map, then running to the nearest base. If the marker is 100m away or more, you must have permission to build in your desired spot. Either find a different spot or ask permission from the nearby base owner.\n\n5) All parts of your buildings must be at least 4 foundations (10 meters) away from any explorer note, dino dossier, etc.\n\n6)Do not build in ruins.\n\n7) Building on the Event Map is NOT ALLOWED.\n\n8) Taming pens built in the wild must be left unlocked for other players to use.\n\n9) Do not build a taming pen in an area where there is another adequate taming pen nearby.\n\n10) Do not enter or take anything, including tames, from bases that do not belong to you. Reports of theft will be investigated and violators will be banned.",
          "text4": "1) All players must be a member of a tribe. Solo players must create a tribe in order to fulfill this requirement.\n\n2) If you are a member of our Discord server, your Discord server nickname must be the same as your Ark survivor name.\n\n3) If running from dinos that are attacking you, do not run near another tribe's base. You will be held responsible for damage caused to another tribe's base.\n\n4) Tribes may have a maximum of 30 dinos placed at a time. Our server makes use of the Pelayori's Cryo Storage, which introduces the Cryo Pods that don't decay to the game. You can also integrate female dinos to the Egg Collector for automatic egg production. Pack your excess dinos into Soul Balls. Store dinos in Cryo Pods when not actively being used.",
