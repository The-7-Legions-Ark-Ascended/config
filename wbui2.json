1) Stay frosty: Do not insult, scam, shit talk, or troll others. Do not bring up controversial topics in global or public channels. Also, always ask if a controversial topic is ok before bringing it up even in private channels.

2) No trolls allowed. No intentional trolling, feigning idiocy, shitposting, or blatant lying. We are a community of people with similar interests just here to have a good time. We do not condone abusive behavior. This is not the place for trying to get a rise out of others.

3) Do not DM our team members. We have a support ticket system in place on our Discord server. Visit us there and submit a ticket to ask for help.

4) No doxxing: We do not allow distribution of ANYONE's sensitive or personal information.

5) Use appropriate survivor names. No blank names, no long names, no URL names, and no non-ASCII Unicode characters in names. Names that contain non-standard characters or emojis are subject to admin name change.

6) No advertising. No referral links. No buying/selling/trading anything for real life goods or money.

7) We do not allow players to use our platform to send others invitations to other Discord servers, game communities, or game servers.

8) Use common sense. If you're doing something you think is wrong, it probably is and will probably get you some attention from the admins.

9) Use English in global chat. If you need to speak another language, use whisper, tribe, or alliance chat.",

These thank you gifts are meant to be just that: a way of saying thank you to the player who made the donation.

Please understand that this is not allowed. Therefore the following rules apply to VIP-related items and dinos unless otherwise noted:
| - VIP players are allowed to breed VIP Exclusive dinos when the chance to do so comes around, but the offspring of a VIP Exclusive dino is also considered VIP Exclusive and MAY NOT be shared with other players
| - VIP players MAY share any base furnishings they may have received as a thank you gift with tribe mates only

4) Your base should be at least 100m apart from each other. You can use map markers to measure distance by placing a map marker at your desired base location, activating it by clicking it on the map, then running to the nearest base. If the marker is 100m away or more, you must have permission to build in your desired spot. Either find a different spot or
